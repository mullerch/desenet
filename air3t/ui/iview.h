 * A view is an object that renders a certain view to the display using the MonochromeDisplayPainter utility class. Calling the
 * update method of such a view will re-render the view. A view will basically send events to the controller if anything changes
 * and the controller can replace a view with another on the screen to have a different functionality available at a certain
 * moment in time. A view is always rendered fullscreen and there is only one view active at the moment.
